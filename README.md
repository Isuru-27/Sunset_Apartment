## Problem Statement

Managing apartment complexes manually or with outdated software poses challenges for property managers, maintenance staff, and residents. Without a dedicated AMS, property managers face increased workloads, higher chances of errors, and difficulties in resident communication. Residents may experience delays in issue resolution and rent-related concerns. This problem is prevalent in apartment complexes, condominiums, and housing associations across various locations, impacting operational efficiency and resident satisfaction.
